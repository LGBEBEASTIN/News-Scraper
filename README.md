# News-Scraper
This app allows users to view NBA articles and comment on their favorites. Each article displayed includes a headline which is also a link to the source article. The app uses Node/Express for the server and routing, MongoDB/Mongoose for the database and models, Handlebars for the layout and views, & Cheerio/Request for scraping the data from basketball.realgm.com.
